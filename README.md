# Server-Monitor-Script-Bash

**The idea is to have a bash script that lets you achieve the following:**

- The script should present a menu which would have a list of tasks to be performed, expect the user to select a metric from the menu

- Total Ram available

- Total storage space available for a mount point\

- List top 5 processes for a specific user

- List the ports exposed and the process associate with it

- Option to free up cached memory

- For a given directory list the files with their size in (MBs), and sort them with descending order

- For a given directory list the Folders with their size in (MBs), and sort them with descending order
